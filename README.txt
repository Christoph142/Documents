Documents is an Opera extension serving as an alternative for various plugins (e.g. Adobe Reader)

Why is it better to use it compared to using a plugin?

+ running natively in Opera and not as a separate process -> can't crash or freeze Opera
+ faster (the document opens pretty much instantly since it is parsed online)
+ saves bandwith and thus money on a data plan (the file does not have to be downloaded at all)
+ mouse gestures are working
+ you can adjust the look and feel by yourself by modifying the extension's code
+ substitutes multiple plugins at once (supports a lot more formats than a usual plugin does)
+ uses less resources
+ works on any device
